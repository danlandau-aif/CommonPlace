## Option 1: Professional & Technical

I built CommonPlace - a privacy-focused clipboard manager for macOS ðŸ“‹

As someone who copies dozens of things daily (code snippets, passwords, notes, screenshots), I needed a clipboard manager that:
âœ… Actually respects my privacy (100% local, nothing sent to the cloud)
âœ… Works seamlessly with password managers
âœ… Stays out of my way

So I built one with Swift + SwiftUI.

**Key features:**
â€¢ Stores last 15 clipboard items (text & images)
â€¢ Smart detection: automatically removes passwords when your password manager clears them
â€¢ Individual item deletion
â€¢ Native macOS interface - lives in your menu bar
â€¢ Completely open source

**Built with:** Swift 5.9, SwiftUI, Combine

The entire codebase is on GitHub - feel free to build it yourself, inspect the code, or contribute improvements.

Would love to hear your feedback! What features would make this more useful for your workflow?

## Option 2: Story-Driven & Casual

Ever copy something important, paste it somewhere... then 10 minutes later need to paste it again but you've copied 5 other things since? ðŸ˜…

That's why I built CommonPlace - a simple clipboard manager for Mac.

**The problem:** I kept losing things I'd copied. Browser passwords would show up in my clipboard history. And every clipboard manager I tried either cost money or sent my data to the cloud.

**The solution:** A dead-simple menu bar app that:
â€¢ Remembers your last 15 copied items
â€¢ Automatically removes passwords (follows your password manager's lead)
â€¢ Stores everything locally - nothing leaves your Mac
â€¢ Is completely free & open source

Built it with Swift in a few days, and it's already saved me hours of re-copying things.

If you're on a Mac and tired of losing clipboard history, give it a try!

## Suggested Images to Include:

1. **Screenshot of the app** - Show the menu bar dropdown with some example clipboard items
2. **Before/After comparison** - "Before: Lost clipboard item ðŸ˜«" vs "After: Found it in CommonPlace âœ…"
3. **Code snippet** - A few lines of the Swift code to show it's real/open source
4. **Feature highlights** - Visual list of the key features

## Tips for Maximum Engagement:

1. **Post timing**: Tuesday-Thursday, 8-10am or 12-1pm for best reach
2. **Add a poll**: "Do you use a clipboard manager?" Yes/No/What's that?
3. **Tag relevant people**: If you know any Swift developers or productivity enthusiasts
4. **First comment**: Add more details in a first comment (how you built it, challenges, etc.)
5. **Engage**: Respond to every comment in the first hour

Pick the style that matches your LinkedIn voice! I'd recommend Option 2 (Story-Driven) for maximum engagement, but Option 1 if your network is mostly technical/developer folks.
