## ✨ Features

- 📋 **Stores 15 most recent items** - Never lose that thing you copied 10 minutes ago
- 🖼️ **Text & Images** - Handles both text snippets and images seamlessly
- 🔒 **Smart Password Manager Detection** - Follows password manager's lead and automatically deletes passwords copied from password managers
- 🗑️ **Individual Item Deletion** - Hover and delete specific items you don't want
- 🚫 **Auto-filters File Paths** - Only captures actual content, not file references
- 🎯 **Native macOS UI** - Clean SwiftUI interface that feels right at home
- 🔐 **100% Private** - All data stored locally in memory, nothing sent to any server
- ⚡ **Lightweight** - Minimal resource usage, lives quietly in your menu bar

## 🎬 How It Works

1. Click the clipboard icon in your menu bar
2. See your recent clipboard history
3. Click any item to copy it again
4. Hover to see delete/copy buttons
5. That's it!

### Smart Password Manager Integration

CommonPlace follows your password manager's lead - when it automatically clears your clipboard (typically after ~90 seconds for security), CommonPlace detects this and removes those items from history too. Your passwords and sensitive data are automatically protected.

## 🚀 Installation

### Option 1: Download Pre-built App (Easy)

1. **[Download CommonPlace v1.0 from Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yAO0cFg-Nwyq6bPWFI4sHbo-Ev-KoG15)** 📥
2. Extract the ZIP and read the included `INSTALL.md` guide
3. Move `CommonPlace.app` to your Applications folder
4. Right-click → Open (first time only, to bypass security warning)
5. Look for the clipboard icon in your menu bar!
