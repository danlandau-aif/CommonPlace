## Features Explained

### Smart 1Password Detection

CommonPlace intelligently detects when items are copied from 1Password:

- When you copy a password/credential from 1Password (desktop app or browser extension)
- 1Password automatically clears your clipboard after ~90 seconds for security
- CommonPlace detects this auto-clear behavior
- The item is automatically removed from your history
- Your sensitive credentials never stay in the clipboard history!

### File Path Filtering

CommonPlace automatically ignores:
- File paths
- File URLs
- Copied files from Finder

Only actual content (text and images) is saved.
